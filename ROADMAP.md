# COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCT ROADMAP
## FlowSpace Platform — Full Build-Out Plan
### Two-Party Action Plan: Copilot (AI Engine) + Lead Engineer (Orchestrator)

---

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This roadmap is divided into **sequential phases**. Each phase contains:
- **COPILOT TASKS** — items the AI coding agent executes directly (code generation, architecture, implementation)
- **LEAD ENGINEER TASKS** — items that require human judgment, accounts, credentials, relationships, or decisions

Work happens **in parallel** where possible. The Lead Engineer unblocks dependencies;
Copilot builds continuously.

## PART III: ADMIN AGENT MANAGEMENT INTERFACE

The admin panel at `/admin` already has the foundation. The agent management section
needs to be built as a new tab/panel:

### FEATURE SPEC: `/admin/agents`

**Copilot must build:**

```
ADMIN AGENT CONTROL CENTRE
├── Active Agents List
│   ├── Agent card: name, specialisation, status (active/paused/training)
│   ├── Task queue (current task, queued tasks)
│   ├── Performance metrics (tasks completed, success rate, last active)
│   └── Controls: Pause, Resume, Reassign, Configure
├── New Agent Registration
│   ├── Name, Specialisation (select from enum), Description
│   ├── Capability tags (multi-select)
│   ├── Prompt configuration (system prompt, constraints)
│   └── Pair assignment (which agent it validates/is validated by)
├── Task Assignment
│   ├── Create new task (title, description, priority, deadline)
│   ├── Assign to agent or pair
│   ├── Dependency mapping (task A must complete before task B)
│   └── Automated trigger (on PR, on deployment, on schedule)
├── Task Monitoring
│   ├── Kanban board (Not Started / In Progress / Review / Done)
│   ├── Live log stream per task
│   ├── Output artifact links (PRs, files changed, test results)
│   └── Escalate to Lead Engineer button
└── Agent Analytics
    ├── Total tasks by agent (weekly/monthly)
    ├── Average completion time
    ├── Validation pass rate
    └── Cost per task (token usage × rate)
```

**Mobile-first design:** The agent panel must be fully operable on mobile
(Lead Engineer manages agents from phone). Use the same dark glassmorphism design system.

**API endpoints needed:**
- `GET /api/admin/agents` — list all agents with current status
- `POST /api/admin/agents` — register new agent
- `PATCH /api/admin/agents/[id]` — update agent status/config
- `GET /api/admin/tasks` — list all tasks
- `POST /api/admin/tasks` — create new task
- `PATCH /api/admin/tasks/[id]` — update task status
- `GET /api/admin/tasks/[id]/logs` — stream task logs (SSE)

**Database tables needed:**
```sql
-- agents table
CREATE TABLE agents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  specialisation TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'frontend' | 'backend' | 'devops'
  role TEXT NOT NULL,            -- 'builder' | 'validator'
  pair_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',  -- 'active' | 'paused' | 'training'
  system_prompt TEXT,
  capabilities TEXT[],
  tasks_completed INT DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- agent_tasks table
CREATE TABLE agent_tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',  -- 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'not_started',
  assigned_agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  depends_on UUID[],  -- task IDs that must complete first
  output_artifacts JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  created_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
